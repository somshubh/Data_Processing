# Data_Processing
   ## This Repo is all about Data Processing, Here I am using python some most useful libraries like : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn etc.
         1. use google play store dataset.
         2. Analysis all columns and got some useful insights.
         3. before the analysis did the data cleaning (Null value handling) using sklearn library (SimpleImputer)
# OS_module
  ### Here i try to do some besic operating system concept that helps a lot for a  data analytics job profile.
         1. Directory makeing
         2. sub directory making
         3. All Files data reading 
         4. directory delete
# Heart Disease Dataset Analysis Project
    Kaggle dataset link: /kaggle/input/heart-desease-dataset/Heart-disease/heart.csv
	kaggle notebook link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/somshubhragiri/heart-disease-explore-analysis
    In this Project we take dataset from kaggle and doing all the analysis in kaggle notebook only.
	Here we plot so many distribution graph and that gives some meaningful insights, use correlation between two columns and plot the heat map using seaborn library.
	After that we check some of the vital correlation using join plot and at the end using pair plot that gives us all possibility correlation map in one frame and it helps to end user understand easily.
